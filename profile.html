	<h1>Stuart Gee Personal Profile</h1>

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Hi my name is Stu, I'm a 26 year old currently living in Gold Coast, Queensland with my girlfriend and dog Lunar. I was born and raised in a small coastal town in mid-north coast New South Wales called Lake Cathie where I finished year 12 and then moved to Gold Coast to study my diploma of Graphic Design and have been up here ever since. I love to surf and when I get the creative bug I love to draw and play guitar and fiddle with music production software like Logic. I can only speak the English language although I would love to learn German or Spanish. </p>
	<p>The reason I'm interested in IT is that I have found that I have always had a passion for creating, whether it be physically building something with my hands, or creating with a pencil or guitar. It wasnâ€™t until I did a work placement in Year 12 with a Local magazine company that my eyes were open to the possibility of creating with a computer. The ability to develop and create all with the click of a button and with endless possibilities really excited me.</p>
	<p>Once I started my Diploma of Graphic Design, I realized I particularly enjoyed website design and app design. I really want to be able to completely make websites and apps from the ground up. So that is why I have decided to pursue my Batchelor of I.T at RMIT. I chose RMIT for its flexible online courses and proven track record. I'm hoping RMIT will give me the tools to become a front end and back end web and app developer. </p>

	<h4>What these results mean to me</h4>
	<p>To me these results are a good representation of my strengths and weaknesses and how I am able to communicate and take in information. Knowing what areas I am weaker in allows me to have some self-reflection and form ideas on how I am able to grow and in turn the areas that I am strong in I can utilize in a group setting. I think it is important to form groups with people that can counteract each other's strengths and weaknesses so that we are able to form a more well-rounded whole. </p>
