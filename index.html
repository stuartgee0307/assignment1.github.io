	<h1>Stuart Gee Personal Profile</h1>
	<h4>Student no: S3866410</h4>
	<h4>Student Email: S3866410@student.rmit.edu.au</h4>
	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Hi my name is Stu, I'm a 26 year old currently living in Gold Coast, Queensland with my girlfriend and dog Lunar. I was born and raised in a small coastal town in mid-north coast New South Wales called Lake Cathie where I finished year 12 and then moved to Gold Coast to study my diploma of Graphic Design and have been up here ever since. I love to surf and when I get the creative bug I love to draw and play guitar and fiddle with music production software like Logic. I can only speak the English language although I would love to learn German or Spanish. </p>
	<p>The reason I'm interested in IT is that I have found that I have always had a passion for creating, whether it be physically building something with my hands, or creating with a pencil or guitar. It wasn’t until I did a work placement in Year 12 with a Local magazine company that my eyes were open to the possibility of creating with a computer. The ability to develop and create all with the click of a button and with endless possibilities really excited me.</p>
	<p>Once I started my Diploma of Graphic Design, I realized I particularly enjoyed website design and app design. I really want to be able to completely make websites and apps from the ground up. So that is why I have decided to pursue my Batchelor of I.T at RMIT. I chose RMIT for its flexible online courses and proven track record. I'm hoping RMIT will give me the tools to become a front end and back end web and app developer. </p>

	<h4>What these results mean to me</h4>
	<p>To me these results are a good representation of my strengths and weaknesses and how I am able to communicate and take in information. Knowing what areas I am weaker in allows me to have some self-reflection and form ideas on how I am able to grow and in turn the areas that I am strong in I can utilize in a group setting. I think it is important to form groups with people that can counteract each other's strengths and weaknesses so that we are able to form a more well-rounded whole. </p>
	
	<h2>Project Idea</h2>
	<p>Bean hunter is an interactive app that is created for the coffee lovers like me, who are in an area they have never been before and are looking for a great coffee but have difficulty finding a good place! It will be designed with game like qualities to make it interactive and fun with real life incentives to rate and share your coffee experience. Instead of wasting $5.50 on an average coffee download Been Hunter app and let other coffee lovers tell you where to go and in turn, they will be rewarded for their help. </p>
	<p>My partner and I recently moved to Burleigh heads and have gone to over 5 cafes looking for a good coffee. This is where we were talking about how we were wishing there was a service like Yelp or Google Reviews that was more specific for coffee. Looking at current coffee apps it became obvious that there wasn’t really anything on the market that was current and useful to the user. Coffee is a ginormous industry within Australia, 5.5 billion dollars a year to be exact (L. Granwal, Apr 30, 2020) and with a huge number of Australians drinking multiple cups every day. I was amazed that there wasn’t something specific to Coffee.</p>
	<p>Bean Hunter will be designed to be beneficial for both the customers and the businesses of coffee shops around Australia for maximum potential. How it will work for the customers is that people looking for coffee will be able to go onto the app and see a map of all shops in the area and have an average rating by previous users and once clicked on a shop icon will go into further detail of five star ratings of things such as, coffee quality, speed of preparation, customer service etc. Once the user has been to the store they can rate and gain credit and level up their Bean Hunter character within the app to build up to use with other businesses' that support the app. This gives the user incentive to rate their experience and turn it into real time rewards. </p>
	<p>For the business they will be able to sign up for an annual fee and be able to be displayed on the app have access to all potential customers within the area, while also getting constant feedback to be able to optimize their business every day. They will also be able to display deals and offers within the app to draw in new customers. The credits used by customers on the app will be covered by the app, so they won't miss out on any financial gain. For this product to be successful it will need to be taken on by a large number of the public in order for it to be financially feasible for the business’ to take on this new technology. </p>
	<p>Some potential software used to create this app would be HTML5, CSS, Java Script using open sourse framework Ionic. “which uses HTML5 programming language and is widely preferred for mobile app development. It combines HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript to build native based apps and create their UI functionalities with ease.” (Girish R., Dec 19,2018). This app is a feasible product as it doesn’t break and boundaries with how it will be developed rather than a simple and interactive idea and layout.</p>
	<p>If the product is successful it will change the way people go out for coffee and raise the bar in the way businesses deliver for customers. It is all about simplifying choice and cutting out wasted money and time. This app will impact the hospitality industry and drive money to small business while keeping the experience simple, fun and interactive. </p>
